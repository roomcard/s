likelyhood probability for P(high/no) is  0.75
likelyhood probability for P(sunny/no) is  0.75
likelyhood probability for P(hot/no) is  0.5
calculating the likelihood for yes
likelyhood probability for P(weak/yes) is  1.0
likelyhood probability for P(high/yes) is  0.5
likelyhood probability for P(sunny/yes) is  0.25
likelyhood probability for P(hot/yes) is  0.25
class label for {'wind': 'weak', 'humidity': 'high', 'outlook': 'sunny', 'temp': 'hot'} is yes
